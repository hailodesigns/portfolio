         <p>Hello, I'm Pearl! I am a female twenty-two year old Goffins Cockatoo that loves being held, cuddling, and dancing along with loud music. I was rescued from a home with many other parrots and birds, and because of all the noise, it made me anxious so I plucked at my feathers. I still get anxious sometimes, but my feathers are slowly growing back! I love eating my veggie mixes but I really like safflower seeds. I only know one word, but I love to say it all the time, “okay!”</p>

         <p>Hello, my name is Sammy! I am a fourteen year old yellow-naped amazon. I love singing, talking, and peanuts. I do not like being held and I am scared of hands, but with time I will get used to it! I love singing songs in the shower and dancing for a treat. I tend to like males more than females, but with enough exposure and time I can learn to interact with anyone. I know a lot of words, some of them not being very nice. I can tend to get an attitude when I do not like something that’s going on or if I do not want anyone bothering me. Sometimes I just need time to myself!</p>

         <p>Hello, my name is Tanaka! I am a 15-20 year old bearded dragon. Some may call me a lazy bones, but I just love being warm and snuggling up against something soft. My favorite treat is blueberries and kale. I lost the end of my tale when I was young, so it is just a nub, but I am perfectly healthy otherwise! Sometimes when I meet other animals like dogs or cats I like to chase them and scare them away.</p>

I do not like being handled, instead, I like burying myself in dirt and relaxing in my water bowl. Every once in a while I’ll croak, just to let you know I’m still here!</p>
